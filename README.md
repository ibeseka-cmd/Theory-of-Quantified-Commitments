A complete, unified economic ontology that grounds all value in **quantified commitments** rather than money, goods, or utility.

This framework derives money, equity, debt, growth, institutions, and crises from a single primitive: the **commitment** (a pledge from a Liable Authority to a Holding Entity). It resolves **all 40 major economic paradoxes** without behavioral patches or separate theories.

## Core Insight

Economic value is not intrinsic or subjective utility—it is the **anchored, framed, and transferable worth** of commitments:

```
CV = CV₀ × V × A × (1 + T)
```

- **CV₀**: Base value (face amount pledged)  
- **V**: Visibility (transparency of terms and dependencies)  
- **A**: Assurance (probability of fulfillment)  
- **T**: Transferability (ease of resale)

Value is always frame-dependent (Law 2), constrained by foundational layers (Law 3), and balanced across five compensation dimensions: Utility, Income, Recognition, Influence, Optionality (Law 7).

The result: a **generative grammar** for economics—where instruments, markets, institutions, and systems emerge lawfully from commitment composition, derivation, and compounding.

## The 23 Laws

| #  | Law                          | Core Concept |
|----|------------------------------|--------------|
| 1  | Commitment Value             | CV = CV₀ × V × A × (1 + T) |
| 2  | Interpretive Framing         | No objective value—only framed value |
| 3  | Dependency Constraint        | No layer can exceed its foundation |
| 4  | Commodity                    | Value emerges from relations interpreted by agents |
| 5  | Non-Transferable Commitment  | Pure relational trust (T=0) |
| 6  | Fair Exchange                | Balanced Exchange Value across dimensions |
| 7  | Compensation                 | U + I + R + Inf + O |
| 8  | Generation                   | PCIX cycle creates new commitments |
| 9  | Derivation                   | Transforming existing commitments |
|10  | Institution                  | Coordinates non-transferables at scale |
|11  | Memory                       | Institutional learning preservation |
|12  | Defense                      | Protection against shocks |
|13  | Reserve Asset                | Anchors value across time |
|14  | Operational Currency         | Maximizes transferability |
|15  | Economic Pulse               | Currency degradation rate λ |
|16  | [Temporal Dynamics]          | (Detailed in full text) |
|17  | Contingent Instruments       | Risk transfer |
|18  | Residual Instrument          | Equity as pure compensation play |
|19  | Price Discovery              | Markets reveal honest uncertainty |
|20  | Capital Allocation           | Civilization’s economic metabolism |
|21  | Economic Growth              | Quality (GQI) over quantity |
|22  | Harvest                      | Sustainable extraction boundary |
|23  | Generativity                 | Compounding trajectory: Gen = G × μ × D × 1/(1+λ) |

## Key Achievements

- **Resolves all 40 canonical economic paradoxes** (Diamond-Water, Allais, Equity Premium, Paradox of Thrift, Triffin, Efficiency-Equity, Second Best, etc.)  
  → See `/paradoxes/40_Economic_Paradoxes_Resolved.md`
- Diagnoses modern crises as violations of natural bounds (DR > 0.123, λ too high, μ < 0.7)
- Prescribes sustainable paths via foundation-first sequencing and generative design
- Accommodates programmable commitments (smart contracts, DAOs) natively

## Getting Started

1. Read the **laws** in order—they build progressively.
2. Explore the **paradox resolutions** to see how traditional anomalies dissolve.
3. Join discussions (Issues) or contribute extensions/models.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Ideas:
- Empirical proxy measurements (V/A/T scores for assets)
- Agent-based simulations of anchor cycles
- Historical case studies (Byzantine high Gen vs. modern low Gen)
- Extensions to crypto, AI economies, climate transitions

Please open issues for discussion first.

**Economics is no longer a collection of contradictory puzzles.**  
It is a coherent science of commitments, frames, and generative flows.  

Welcome to the paradigm shift.
